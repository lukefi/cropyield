Cropyield project WP1 code documentation
=========================================

Documentation for `this <https://github.com/myliheik/cropyield>`_ code.

This documentation describes the content and usage of the code written for the WP1 in the Cropyield project by the 
Finnish Geospatial Research Institute in the National Land Survey of Finland, `FGI <https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/research/departments/remote-sensing-and-photogrammetry>`_ from 2018 until 2020 as a subcontractor for the Natural Resources Institute Finland (`LUKE <https://www.luke.fi/en/>`_).
The code is prepared according to algorithm descriptions made by LUKE (see Appendix).

The code provided can be used to extract Sentinel-2 pixelvalues per object (polygon in a shapefile, here field parcels). Specified data access and inputshape-handling is also taken care of. Additional scripts are provided to further process the extracted values into histograms and to split the shapefile according to Sentinel-2 tiles.

Example in- and outputs can be found in the updated Algorithm in the appendix.
